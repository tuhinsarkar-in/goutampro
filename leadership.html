                    <p>The best products are built by happy, motivated, and supported teams. I prioritize mentorship and
                        create clear career pathways to help every designer grow and achieve their professional goals.

                        we
                        identify opportunities and deliver solutions that are viable for the business and technically

                            <p>At Prozis, I built the UX design practice from the ground up, hiring and onboarding an
                                8-person distributed team. I developed a structured hiring process that assessed not
                                just
                                craft, but also collaborative spirit and strategic thinking.</p>

                            <p>As UX Manager at OutSystems, I helped structure a large, 80-person design and research
                                organization. This involved defining clear responsibilities for sub-teams like Design
                                Systems and Research Ops to ensure we could operate effectively at scale.</p>

                            design, product management, and engineering, ensuring we operate as one cohesive product

                            <p>I integrate design into the entire product lifecycle by establishing shared rituals like
                                co-creation workshops, design sprints, and regular triad meetings (Product, Design,
                                Engineering). This builds mutual respect and a shared understanding of goals.</p>

                                connecting design decisions to user needs and business KPIs, I empower my team to make

                                a transparent project tracker, or joint planning sessions, my goal is to break down

                                and foster a "one team" mentality.</p>

                                and

                                systems that free up designers to focus on what they do best: solving problems.</p>
